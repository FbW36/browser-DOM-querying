# Menu Styling 
In the repository, there is an `index.html` starting file which has the skeleton of an online menu. Style the menu by following the instructions below. 

**Rule**: All changes to the menu should be done in JavaScript! No CSS!!

* Change the font of the body element. 
* Center the text of h1 on the page.
* The menu headings have a class named `category`. Select the elements by class name. Then, change the `color` and `font-style` of each element. 
* Create a function named "_colorGenerator_" that returns a different color. Select the `food-item`s on the page. Give each item a different color using the function that you created.
* Select the warning at the end of the page by its id `warning`. Select the id without using a querySelector. Change the size and font of the `warning`.
* Select all even `allergy-info` items. Give the even items a different background color.
